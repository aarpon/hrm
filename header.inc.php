// huygens remote manager is a software that has been developed at 
// Montpellier Rio Imaging (mri) in 2004 by Pierre Travo and Volker 
// Baecker. It allows running image restoration jobs that are processed 
// by 'Huygens professional' from SVI. Users can create and manage parameter 
// settings, apply them to multiple images and start image processing 
// jobs from a web interface. A queue manager component is responsible for 
// the creation and the distribution of the jobs and for informing the user 
// when jobs finished.

// This software is governed by the CeCILL license under French law and 
// abiding by the rules of distribution of free software. You can use, 
// modify and/ or redistribute the software under the terms of the CeCILL 
// license as circulated by CEA, CNRS and INRIA at the following URL 
// "http://www.cecill.info".

// therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced 
// professionals having in-depth IT knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged 
// to load and test the software's suitability as regards their requirements
