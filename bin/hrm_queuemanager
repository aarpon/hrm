# hrm_queuemanager     Huygens Remote Manager - Queue Manager wrapper script
#
# This is the daemon wrapper script for running the HRM Queue Manager (QM).
#
# It works the following way:
# - Reads in the default configuration file (/etc/hrm.conf) unless an
#   environment variable $HRM_CONF is set, in that case this one is used.
# - From the $HRM_LOG setting configured in the config, the settings for the
#   logs (default and error) and the PID files are derived and checked for
#   existence and appropriate permissions (read/write).
# - The config is checked if a system account for the HRM daemon has been
#   configured ($SUSER setting), otherwise it stops.
# - As the QM is not designed to run multiple instances at the same time it is
#   checking if a QM is already running. This is done by using the
#   corresponding functions required to be provided by any LSB compliant
#   distribution. See http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/ for more details.
# - In case the script was run as root, it re-exec's itself with the user
#   account configured in the $SUSER variable. In case it was started as
#   non-root it checks if this matches $SUSER (otherwise writing previews and
#   deconvolution results would fail).
# - If the script was started with the parameter '--detach' it forks itself
#   into the background to run as a daemon. In fact this is done by
#   re-executing itself as well as a subprocess (removing the 'detach'
#   parameter) and then terminating the parent process.
# - Having reached this point means that all sanity checks were successful,
#   the script is running under the appropriate user account and was forked
#   into the background if requested.
# - For being able to handle shutdown requests in a meaningful way (i.e. to
#   clean up), a signal handler for SIGINT and SIGTERM is set up. In case one
#   of these signals is sent to the daemon, the "cleanup_exit" function is
#   triggered.
# - Before actually launching the QM, a marker with the current date and time
#   is written to both log files for being able to identify which entries
#   belong to a certain session.
# - Then the actual PHP QM is launched as a subprocess. The PID of this
#   subprocess is remembered in a variable. Note that it is *NOT* the PID that
#   gets written to the pidfile later on! Instead, the PID of the daemon
#   wrapper script is stored there as *this* is what should receive kill
#   requests etc. If writing the pidfile fails, the script stops the QM and
#   quits.
# - After launching the QM, the script is switching to monitoring mode: in an
#   endless loop it keeps checking once a second if the status of the
#   subprocess (the QM). In case the status has changed (meaning that is has
#   crashed or was shut down explicitly, which is not intended) the cleanup
#   function is called and the script exits.
# - The cleanup function (which is also triggered directly if the script
#   receives the TERM or INT signal) sends the TERM signal to the QM, removes
#   the pidfile and then exits.

WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING

Your setup does not have the "SUSER" variable configured to be used for running
the HRM Queue Manager. Usually, this results in the daemon being run as root.

This configuration has been DEPRECATED as of HRM 3.1.0 and is not supported in
HRM 3.2.0 and newer releases. Please see the documentation how to correctly
configure your HRM:
